# Computer science coursework: Monopoly
IMPORTANT NOTE: This project uses Nuget packages (MahApps and MahApps icons) to provide skins for the default WPF controls, and (as a result) will not work without!

SECOND IMPORTANT NOTE: As it stands, this project does NOT use the 'Boards' directory in _Monopoly\Resources\Boards_. Instead, it creates its own directory that can be found under _My Documents\Monopoly_. In order to be able to start any game, you will need to add a board file (.mboard) into that _My Documents\Monopoly\Boards_ folder. One board file - named "UK Classic Board.mboard" - is provided in this project's root directory.
