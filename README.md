# Computer science coursework: Monopoly
IMPORTANT NOTE: This project uses Nuget packages (MahApps and MahApps icons) to provide skins for the default WPF controls, and (as a result) will not work/will look incredibly interesting without these packages.

SECOND IMPORTANT NOTE: No board will at first appear selectable in the dialog. This is because it is attempting to read from a newly created directory in 'My Documents'. Drag the .mboard file provided into that directory after first initialising the game, and - once you've restarted the app - the board should appear as normal. This directory is _Documents\Monopoly\Boards_.
